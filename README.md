ShufflePlus is a editing tool for Spotify playlists that adds extra features such as playlist sorting, merging and archiving.

## How & Why

This was one of my first ever coding projects and I decided to re-make it with new features, a new look and using new tools. The app will be primarily client-side as it gets all its data directly from the Spotify API. Necessary session data will be stored in the state using Zustand and no user data will be stored in a database.

- For the frontend, I am using Next.js and React.
- Zustand handles state for deeply nested components.
- Deployed with Vercel.
- Mantine is helping out with the styling.

More is to come.
